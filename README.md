# Dynamic-Weather
This purpose is to design a dynamic weather site using the API and gain experience working with the API.

# How Does It Work
+ You should put your own API key obtained from https://openweathermap.org/api in the relevant place in the scripts.js file.
+ You can write to searchbar Which city you want to know the weather.
+ The images and data on the website are all completely dynamic and change according to the information of the data.
